# Digit_Recognition
Handwritten Digit Recognition Using OpenCV and Python
Dataset used
For this project I used the MNIST dataset. It is freely available on the Internet.

Requirements
Python 3
Sklearn
OpenCV 3
numpy
Jupyter-Notebook
Training SVM model
SVM_Classifier.ipynb - This is a ipython notebook so you need jupyter-notebook installed to use this file. Use this file if you want to retrain the model.
digits_cls1.pkl - This is a saved SVM model file.
Digit recognition using OpenCV
dig_rec.ipynb - This is a ipython notebook for recognising handwritten digit in images using OpenCV .This file is using trained SVM model digits_cls1.pkl.

Real time single digit recognition using OpenCV
dig_rec_vid.ipynb - This is a ipython notebook for recognising single handwritten digit using webcam and OpenCV .This file is also using trained SVM model digits_cls1.pkl.

Real time multi digit recognition using OpenCV
multidig_rec_vid.ipynb - This is a ipython notebook for recognising multi handwritten digit using webcam and OpenCV .This file is also using trained SVM model digits_cls1.pkl.

How to use these projects
You can use these projects direct opening the perticular ipython notebook dig_rec.ipynb or dig_rec_vid.ipynb or multidig_rec_vid.ipynb.
